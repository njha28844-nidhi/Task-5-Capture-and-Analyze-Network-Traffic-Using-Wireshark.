# Network Traffic Analysis – Task 5 Report

## Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic and identify key network protocols without using Wireshark.

## Capture Summary
A traffic capture was performed using:
`sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap`

Traffic was generated by:
- Browsing websites
- Ping tests
- General system background connections

## Observed Protocols
### ✔ DNS
Hostname lookups such as `google.com`.

### ✔ TCP
Seen during connection establishment and data exchange.

### ✔ HTTPS (TLS)
Encrypted communication between browser and websites.

### ✔ ICMP
Ping echo request & reply packets.

### ✔ ARP
Used for local network address resolution.

## Findings
- All captured packets were consistent with normal system activity.
- No suspicious or malformed packets were observed.
- Protocol behavior matched expected patterns.

## Conclusion
Task completed successfully with a complete PCAP capture and protocol analysis.
